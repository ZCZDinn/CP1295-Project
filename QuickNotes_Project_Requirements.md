# CP1295 — Mini-Project (20%): "QuickNotes" – Browser‑Based Sticky‑Note Board

**Individual Project – Due August 10, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. (D2L submission)**

## 1. Purpose

QuickNotes is a compact single‑page web app that lets users create, move, edit, and delete virtual sticky notes directly in the browser. The workload is sized for 20% of the course grade while exercising every major topic in CP1295:

- DOM manipulation & events
- Custom objects & classes
- Browser storage & DevTools
- Asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, async/await)
- ES‑module organisation
- JSON parsing & generation
- Core Git / GitHub practices

## 2. Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Build and manipulate DOM elements with JavaScript events.
- Encapsulate state in a custom class (Note).
- Persist client‑side data with localStorage and inspect it in DevTools.
- Write and consume asynchronous code that fetches external data.
- Structure a small codebase with ES modules (import/export).
- Serialize and deserialize data to/from JSON.
- Apply disciplined version control in a public GitHub repository.

## 3. Mandatory Features (Minimum Viable Product)

| # | Feature | Specification |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Add note | Typing text (or double‑clicking the board) creates a coloured note `<div>` at the cursor. |
| 2 | Edit note | Click note ➜ inline textarea or modal; blur / Esc saves. |
| 3 | Drag & drop | Click‑drag moves a note; position persists. |
| 4 | Delete note | "🗑️" button removes it with a fade‑out. |
| 5 | Persistence | Notes (text, colour, x, y) auto‑save to localStorage; restored on refresh. |
| 6 | Random‑quote enhancer | "💡" icon on a note fetches a productivity quote from an open API (async/await, error‑handled). |
| 7 | ES‑module layout | Minimum files: main.js, ui.js, notes.js, storage.js. |
| 8 | JSON export | "Export" button downloads my‑notes.json containing all notes. |

## 3A. Add-On Requirements (What needs to be done in this project by coding)

| # | New Feature | What you must build |
| A | Images inside notes | Provide an icon (or drag-and-drop) so users can attach an image to a sticky note.
• Store the image so it survives reloads (use a Data-URL in localStorage or a Blob in IndexedDB).
• Scale it to fit neatly and keep the note’s text editable. |
| B | Timestamp | Automatically stamp each note with its creation date-and-time (e.g., “2025-07-09 14:37”) and display it. Persist the timestamp with the note. |
| C | Sort buttons |  Add **Ascending** and **Descending** buttons that reorder all notes by timestamp and re-render the board. |

These enhancements are **required**; omitting any will reduce Functionality marks. Demonstrate each one in the narrated demo video (>=5min).


## 4. GitHub Workflow Requirement

- Create a public repository before writing any code.
- Initialise with a meaningful README that states the project goal.
- Use at least one feature branch (e.g., feature/drag) and merge through Pull Requests.
- Record ≥ 8 meaningful commits (no single "final" dump).
- Comment on each PR and tag the final commit v1.0.0 before submission.
- A weak commit history will cap your GitHub workflow credit.

## 5. D2L Submission Requirements

- Working GitHub link — the tagged release URL (https://github.com/…/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
- Demo video (≤ 3 min) — screen recording with your own narration that shows:
  - User workflow (add, edit, drag, delete, export, quote fetch)
  - Overall code structure (modules, class, storage).
- No additional written report is required.

## 6. Marking Rubric (20%)

| Category | Criteria | Marks |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Functionality | All eight MVP features operate as specified | 10 |
| Code quality | Clear naming, modular structure, comments | 4 |
| Demo video | At least five minutes; audible narration; shows UI flow and key code; clear resolution | 6 |

## 7. Recommended Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Repo + README; basic HTML/CSS layout; add‑note feature; start drag-and-drop |
| 2 | Complete drag‑and‑drop & delete; implement Note class; localStorage save/load |
| 3 | Refactor to ES modules; quote fetch with async/await; error handling |
| 4 | JSON export; UI polish; record demo video; tag release; submit on D2L |

## 8. Technical Constraints & Advice

- Plain HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks).
- Target evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- Keep styles light; dark mode optional.
- Follow the Murach JavaScript style guide.
- Cite any significant external code inspirations in the README.

## 9. Academic Integrity

Discuss ideas freely, but write your own code. Uncredited copying will trigger disciplinary procedures at the college level.
